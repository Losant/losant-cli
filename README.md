# Losant CLI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Losant/losant-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Losant/losant-cli) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/losant-cli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/losant-cli)

## Description

[Losant CLI](https://docs.losant.com/cli/overview) is a command line tool to help manage your [Losant Application](https://docs.losant.com/applications/overview/) and its resources.
It easily lets you manage [Experience Views](https://docs.losant.com/experiences/views/), [Experience Versions](https://docs.losant.com/experiences/versions/), [Files](https://docs.losant.com/applications/files/), and [Data Tables](https://docs.losant.com/data-tables/overview/) in your Applications.

## Installation

The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8.3 or higher. The latest stable version is available in NPM and can be installed using:

```bash
npm install -g losant-cli
```

## Usage

```bash
losant [options] [command]
```

## Commands

* [login](#login)
* [set-token](#set-token)
* [configure](#configure)
* [experience](#experience)
* [files](#files)
* [datatables](#data-tables)

### Login

Before you run any other commands, you must run `losant login` to authenticate with your Losant account. This command checks to see if your account is linked to a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider. If so, the command will prompt for a User Token; otherwise it will prompt for the password (and optionally your two-factor code) for your Losant account. After either is given successfully, the command will store
the authentication token on your computer. With this command, you can optionally set `LOSANT_API_URL` as an environment variable; e.g. `LOSANT_API_URL=<api.private.install> losant login`. By default the CLI will use `https://api.losant.com` as the API URL. This will allow you to log in across Losant installations. If you are logged in to multiple Losant installations when you configure a directory, you will be asked which API token to use to access the application. From then on, any request for that application will use the same API URL.

### Set-token

The set-token command, `losant set-token`, is an alternative way to log in for those users whose account is linked to a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider. This will take the given token, verify that token against the API, and then set it on your user configuration file. With this command, you can optionally set the `LOSANT_API_URL` as an environment variable; e.g. `LOSANT_API_URL=<api.private.install> losant set-token`. By default the CLI will use `https://api.losant.com` as the API URL. This will allow you to set a token for any Losant private installation, and will allow you to set up multiple tokens (or use the `login` command) for different Losant installations. If you do log in to multiple Losant installations, when configuring a directory for an application, the `configure` command will ask which API to use to find the application. From then on, any request for that application will use the same API URL.

### Configure

The `losant configure` command configures and links the current directory to one of your Losant Applications. Once you have configured you will notice a few new directories into your current directory. There will be the following directories added:

* experience/components
* experience/pages
* experience/layouts
* files/
* dataTables/

This is how the CLI will be able to detect new files, experience views, or data tables that you want to add, update or remove from your Losant Application. The files directory will contain and reflect the directory and files on your Losant Application's Files. Similarly, the dataTables directory will contain your Losant Application's data tables as csv files. and The experience directory is broken down by view type (components, layouts and pages), e.g. if you want to create a new component add this to your components directory, or if you want to remove a page, you will find that page located under experience/pages.
